        <h3>Summury</h3>
        <p>
            I am a third-year student at UCSD, majoring in Data Science and Math-Computer Science. I have a strong interest in the financial sector, including investments, funds, and stock markets, and have hands-on experience in the stock, futures, and options markets. My goal is to leverage data science and computational tools to address financial challenges, allowing me to deepen my understanding of both fields and integrate them effectively.
